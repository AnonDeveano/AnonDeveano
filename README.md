- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Gutta. I'm glad and excited that you made it to my Github. 
- :monocle_face: I started learning Solidity in April/May 2021 and have been on it on a near daily basis since. When I deployed my first smart contract on the Rinkeby test net, I realized this is what would make me feel fulfilled.
- :purple_heart: Iâ€™m really looking for any solid opportunity to use these skills that I learned/am learning. Hard work isn't a deterrent to me. My dream would be to be to work in Web3 full time.
- :computer: Current Technologies: Solidity, Typescript (learning), Truffle, Ganache, React, and Git/Github at the moment. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dev_attug@protonmail.com
