- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, the name is Anon Deveano. 
- :monocle_face: I'm an aspiring Web3 dev. I'm self taught, ambitious, and hard work is a challenge rather than a deterrent. At this point, I've been learning for close to a year and I'm currently working on my unguided project.
- :computer: Current project details: Backend done with Solidity and front end will be done in TypeScript. To bring everything full circle, I'll also need to deploy a bot/script in JS
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: I still plan to deploy Polarlys (Tomb fork) 
- :purple_heart: Iâ€™m looking to add value in the Web3 space and converting to Web3 full time would be my dream. 
- :computer: Current Technologies: Solidity, Typescript (learning), Truffle, Ganache, React, and Git/Github; more will be added as I need to learn them.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dev_attug@protonmail.com or Twitter at @anon_deveano
