- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, the name is Gutta. 
- :monocle_face: I'm an aspiring Web3 dev. I'm self taught, ambitious, and hard work is a challenge rather than a deterrent. At this point, I've been learning for close to a year and I'm currently working on my unguided project.
- :computer: Current Project: Dead Man's Switch. Smart Contract: [:white_check_mark:, minus getters], Front End: [:soon:]
- :purple_heart: Iâ€™m looking to add value in the Web3 space and converting to Web3 full time would be my dream. 
- :computer: Current Technologies: Solidity, Javascript (learning), Truffle, Ganache, React, and Git/Github; more will be added as I need to learn them.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dev_attug@protonmail.com or Twitter at @anon_deveano
