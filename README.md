- 👋 Hello, I’m @DevGutta
- 👀 I was originally introduced to crypto in 2017 right before that first 5 figure legendary bull run that ended ~20k. Even then, I didn't really understand what crypto was and when that bear market in 2018 took hold, I lost interest in the space. What a mistake. I entered the space again at the end of 2020 and fully immersed myself in it. A few months in, I realized that trading didn't really bring me any joy and eventually decided that I wanted to become a programmer. I had tried my hands at other languages in the past but none ever satisfied me. When I deployed my first smart contract on the Rinkeby test net, I realized this is what would mmake me happy. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity and have experience in React.js and Next.js. I'm not really worried about my weaknesses here because when you think about it, nothing stops you from learning whatever you want. With that freeing mentality, I'll learn any necessary components to support Solidity. 
- 💞️ I’m really looking for any solid opportunity to use these skills that I really committed to learn.
