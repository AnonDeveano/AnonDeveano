- 👋 Hello, I’m Gutta. I'm glad and excited that you made it to my Github. 
- :grin: I've been a crypto enthusiast for a long time but only made the jump to learning programming in the crypto space this year. I originally took a CS50 course online last year but the workload was incredibly difficult for someone with no programming experience. I took a few months off after that and really realized that learning programming in the context of the crypto space was the only way I wanted to commit to. 
- :monocle_face: I started learning Solidity in April/May 2021 and have been on it on a near daily basis since. When I deployed my first smart contract on the Rinkeby test net, I realized this is what would make me feel fulfilled.
- :brain: I’m currently honing my Solidity skills on my first unguided project. I also have experience in React.js and Next.js but they were bundled in with some tutorials. THe tutorials were committed for Git/Github practice. I'm not really worried about my weaknesses here because I don't see a reason why I couldn't learn the necessary skills to support Solidity. 
- :purple_heart: I’m really looking for any solid opportunity to use these skills that I learned/am learning. Hard work isn't a deterrent to me. My dream would be to be to work in crypto full time.
- :computer: Current Technologies: Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, minor experience in React.js/Next.js, and Git/Github at the moment. More will be added as I become more experienced.
- 📫 How to reach me dev_attug@protonmail.com but the fastest way is through Twitter at ___gutta (3 underscores).
